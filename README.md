# C Programming Practice Collection

A comprehensive collection of **C language practice programs** covering core programming fundamentals, data handling, algorithms, and standard library usage. This repository reflects consistent hands-on practice with C and demonstrates a strong understanding of problem-solving using structured and procedural programming.

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains multiple small-to-medium C programs written while practicing and strengthening core concepts of the C programming language. Instead of focusing on individual problem explanations, the project highlights **breadth of concepts**, **logical thinking**, and **syntax mastery** expected from a professional C programmer.

The code includes examples of input/output handling, conditional logic, loops, arrays, strings, mathematical operations, and classic algorithms.

---

## 🛠️ Concepts & Skills Demonstrated

* Fundamental C syntax and program structure
* Input/Output operations using `stdio.h`
* Conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, ternary operator)
* Looping constructs (`for`, `while`)
* Operators (arithmetic, relational, logical, increment/decrement)
* Arrays (static & dynamic)
* String manipulation (`strlen`, `strcmp`, `fgets`, `puts`)
* Mathematical functions (`pow`, `sqrt`, `floor`, `ceil`)
* Searching algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)
* Sorting algorithm (Bubble Sort)
* Basic problem-solving patterns (palindrome, digit operations)
* Memory and size understanding using `sizeof`
